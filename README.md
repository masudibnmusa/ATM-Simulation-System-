# ATM-Simulation-System-
This project is a console-based ATM simulation written in C. It uses file handling to store and retrieve user account and transaction data. The system allows users to log in with an account number and PIN, perform deposits, withdrawals, check balances, and view transaction history â€” all saved securely in text files.
